# hobby-mat

## Description

Hobby Mat is a project about a platform that connects households that typically cook food everyday but would like to have access a list of their favorite meals and especially how and how often they were cooked. It is a food log, where a household is logging food activity and ingredients. It can be used to rapidly access a view and help planning for whatâ€™s to be cooked in the future.

A first MVP could be a platform where the household is able to register their food activity and view it in an efficient way. A list of features can be added like to plan for the week and produce a grocery list, calculate intake of calories, link with recipes and ingredients and share with other users.
